            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>YOU all know the Miſerable Diſtractions and Confuſions unto which you have of late Years been brought, by Blind and Sla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſh Compliances with the Arbitrary Powers Aſſumed by the King: You have had neither Lawful Mayors nor Sheriffs, nor other Officers of Juſtice, nor any of thoſe Legal Courts of Law or Equity, which your Antient Cuſtoms, and the Common Law, had Eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for your Juſt and Honourable Government. You cannot be Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant the Impending Dangers over very many of your Lives and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates are Infinite; if the Rigour of the Laws ſhould be now Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted againſt all that exerciſed Illegal Powers, and have in ſeveral manners been partakers therein, and thereby now hold ſeveral In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts; and there is no means under Heaven left to Re-eſtabliſh your lawful Government, and ſecure your Perſons and Eſtates, but the Authority of the whole Kingdom in Parliament.</p>
            <p>This being your Caſe, you ought to be cautious and ſtudious how you proceed to conſtitute ſuch a full and free Common Council of the Kingdom in Parliament, as may conſult about neceſſary Proviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons for your Peace, Security and Freedom, without fear of <hi>Force,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out promiſes or hopes from any man of <hi>Preferment,</hi> or <hi>Honours,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out entring into any New Oaths or Obligations inconſiſtent with the preſent ſtate of Him and the Kingdom, and ſuch a Council as may proceed with Impartial Juſtice, and true ſence of the Antient <hi>Rights</hi> and <hi>Freedom</hi> now juſtly demanded by the Kingdom, under the Shel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the Arms of the Moſt Noble Prince of <hi>ORANGE.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You ought to conſider that the King ſeeing himſelf Unable to Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe Popery, and maintain his Arbitrary deſpotick Power over you, hath Deſerted and Abandon'd the Adminiſtration of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and refuſed all care to Protect you; which together with his Deſtruction of the Laws, and Governing by his Will and Force, have by the Laws of God and man, Abſolved you from all duties of Subjection to him.</p>
            <p>You muſt neither forget that you, with the reſt of the Kingdom, have now joyned with His Highneſs the Prince of <hi>ORANGE</hi> in his Declaration that the <hi>Government</hi> is ſubverted;

            <p>You ought to remember, that 'tis the Import and Intent of the Writ now ſent you to chooſe Citizens to Repreſent you in <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> that you by them ſhould meet the King at <hi>Westminſter,</hi> to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult with Him concerning all the great Affairs of the Kingdom: And that the expreſs <hi>Statute-Laws</hi> require, That your Repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives that ſhall be choſen by His Writ, ſhall firſt Renew their Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment of Him, and Obligation to Him; by Swearing O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience and Allegiance to him, and thoſe Laws make Null and Void all the Elections of thoſe that ſhall either refuſe, or Neglect to Take ſuch an Oath.</p>
            <p>This being your preſent State and Caſe, 'tis Humbly Offered to you all, to Conſider whether you can Legally, with Honeſty or Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, proceed upon the Kings preſent Writ, to Elect your Deputies to meet him in Parliament?</p>
            <p>Do you think your ſelves free in a legal manner, to Conſult with the King in Parliament, by your Repreſentatives, whilſt you ſtand Declared <hi>Traytors</hi> and <hi>Rebels?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Do you intend now you have Caſt off and Renounced your Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of Obedience to the Kings Uſurped enſlaving Powers over you, to acknowledge Him as if He were Innocent, and to Swear a New Obedience to him, before his Renunciation of any of thoſe Powers, or the leaſt Security againſt them in Futurity?</p>
            <p>Do you intend to Entangle your ſelves and the Kingdom in need, leſs and endleſs Diſputes with him; And in the Interim, by want of Settlement, Trade and Commerce, to be Deſtroyed; the Kingdom Endangered, Waſted and Devoured with Vaſt Numerous Armies; and time given to Him to procure <hi>French</hi> Armies, to Involve the Kingdom in Blood and Confuſion?</p>
            <p>If you have Wiſdom to Underſtand the things of your Peace, and to avoid the preſent dangerous Snare of Electing for Parliament by his Writ, you ſhall have ſuddenly ſhown you the only Lawful means of providing for your Safety, Peace and Freedom, wherein you may juſtly hope for the Divine Bleſſing.</p>
